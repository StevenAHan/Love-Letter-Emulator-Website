# Love Letter Emulator (WIP)

A website that uses socket.io in order to emulate a multiplayer game of the card game Love Letter. The website supports the base game of Love Letter, which supports 2-4 players.

## Usage

You must have Node.js installed onto your computer. Download the server folder and all of its files, and run the server file. In order to do so, you must go to the server folder location in terminal and run:
```
npm start
```
Once the server is up on your local host, you can go to "localhost:3000". Enter in your name and join a room. Another player on the same computer can join the same room with another name, and once you have the desired amount of players, the host of the room may start the game.
